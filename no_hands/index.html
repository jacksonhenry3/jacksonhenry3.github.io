				<h1>Our Mission</h1>
				<p>
					No Hands Theatre was founded in Northampton, MA with the purpose of bringing innovative theatrical works to the artistic and vibrant Pioneer Valley community. No Hands provides an opportunity for theatre artists of various backgrounds and disciplines, such as dance, music, puppetry, mask work, and circus performance, to learn from each other and expand themselves as performers and creators. Through this collaboration, we aim to merge physicality, movement, and text based performance in order to engage audiences in a unique and compelling theatrical experience.
