                    <h4>html5</h4>
                    <p>
                        I started working with html5 earlier this year but have progressed significantly since my start. It is used mainly to create the structure of the web page to be styled by CSS and a frame work in which JavaScript can be used. HTML5 is great because it allows direct insertion of new media, such as video or audio, in to web pages.

                    <h4>CSS3</h4>
                    <p>
                        CSS3 has been one of the most exciting things for me to learn. It is so simple and can be so powerful. Simple animations and effects can be created that were simple not possible with CSS 2.1 . I have used CSS 3 to make interesting interactive  visuals, but mostly use it to engage the site visitor with interesting dynamics in a web page.

                    <h4>javascript</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is where my skills shine most. I have been programming in JavaScript for a little over two years now. I started seriously digging in to it a couple moths ago and haven't looked back. I have written a number of simulations in JavaScript and have used it to dynamically generate HTML content for an easily manipulatable web page. My favorite program to date being a <a href = 'http://codepen.io/anon/pen/arghx'> bouncing ball program</a> .I also have some experience with d3 a data visualization library and jquery.
