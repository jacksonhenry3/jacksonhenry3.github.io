                                    After having a crazy realization about how all the math ive done so far is linear algebra i wrote this program. It can transform discrete data in to cartesian space to fourier space, or back.

                                    The figures themselves are relatively simple, but beautiful. They are parametric functions where both the x and y are described by either a sine or a cosine. The real fun starts when you mess around with their coefficients ...

                                    Continued fractions are fractions whose denominator is a fraction whos denominator is a fraction and so on ad infinitum.This is a program I wrote quite a while ago in Python. It was created primarily to help me with some math I was doing with continued fractions.

                                    The Sirpinski Triangle is a fractal. It is made up of smaller copies of itself. The best way to describe it is as a triangle made of triangles made of triangles. This particular program is based on addressing each node in the triangle.

                                    Given an initial condition and a quadratic equation this will draw a line which turns at each value, if it is stable iterator then the line will end up at the intersections of y = x and the quadratic equation or through the same 4 points over and over again. If it is unstable it will keep going wildly
