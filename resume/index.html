				<h1>Science</h1>
				<p>I've been programming in python for several years, and in javascript and mathematica for just over one. I'm much more comfortable in python and that is my language of choice for scientific programming because of it's ease of use and various libraries (numpy , scipy , mlab , matplotlib , sympy). </p>
