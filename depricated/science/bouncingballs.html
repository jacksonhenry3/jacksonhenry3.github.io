                    <h2>Consultant, Concord Consortium</h2>
                    <p>Concord, MA : 2011-2012</p>

                        I worked with the concord consortium, a nonprofit scientific education company. I worked on the next gen molecular workbench project to check and see if the simulation of radial bonds they were implementing was correct. I examined the javascript code and extracted from it frequency data from several different simulations. I then took this data and plotted it using python and found a discrepancy between the expected frequency (that of the same simulation in the java version of MW) and my found frequency. This lead them to correct several parameters and fix the simulation. I also created a setup guide for Ubuntu so others running the OS could participate in the project.

                    <h2>Intern, UMass Gravitational Wave Group</h2>
                    <p>Amherst, MA : 2011-2012<p>
                    <p> 
                        I worked with the Gravitational Wave Group at UMass,  Amherst, most closely with grad student Satya Mohapatra and Prof. Laura Cadonati. I learned python and created various charts and visualizations for the team.  I attended meetings periodically and shared my results with the entire group. I continued my work with them over junior year summer i worked on a visualisation of the r mode oscillations of a neutron star.
