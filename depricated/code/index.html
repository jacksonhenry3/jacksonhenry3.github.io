			<p>
				This simple simulation written using <a href = 'http://d3js.org/'>d3</a> produces circles that bounce arround as if there were on a planet similar to earth but with no atmosphere... and 100% effecient collisions. It's my first javascript simulation that I am really quite proud of although it is terribly innefecient.

			<p>
				One of the great things about mathematica that I hadn't really been able to explore was it's built in data. With this project I wrote a very short script that pulls down data and shows it in a chart.

			<p>
				The Sirpinski Triangle is a <a href = 'http://www.wikipedia.com/fractals'>fractal</a>. It is made up of smaller copies of itself. The best way to describe it is as a triangle made of triangles made of triangles ...
			</p>
			<div class = 'subcatagory'>My Programs</div>
			<p>
				I wrote two programs that would generate <em>aproximations</em> of the Sierpinksi triangle. One based on adressing each node in the triangle and the other by a stochastic (random) process.

			<p>
				The next piece of my Python plotting adventure was to plot surfaces. I began with a sphere and from there quickly progressed to more interesting shapes. Ending, under the direction of Satya (a grad student who was helping me), on spherical harmonics. Which at the time I had no understanding of, and I now have a very limmited understanding of.

			<div class = 'subcatagory'>About The Program</div>
			<p>
				If you haven't read about Lissajous figures yet, check out my previous post. 3D Lissajous figures are essentialy the same thing, but with a third parameter. the functions that describe x y and z are all periodic. This creates lots of intricate beautifull figures that weave in and out of themselves.

			<div class = 'section_title'>2D Lissajous figures (Python)</div>
			<div class = 'subcatagory'>About Lissajous Figures</div>
			<p>
				In my quest to learn Python for scientific plotting I started plotting lissajous figures. The figures themselvs are relativly simple, but beautifull. They are parametric functions where both the x and y are described by either a sine or a cosine. The real fun starts when you mess arround with their coefecients ...
